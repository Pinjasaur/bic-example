# My Draft Post

This is some draft post.

It won't be rendered under posts, but will exist under `/drafts`. Plus, the
`entry.html` uses the `draft` key to conditionally add the `noindex` value via a
`<meta>` tag. This should prevent drafts from being indexed by search engines.

It's a nice way to get feedback and iterate on a post. Once you're ready to
publish, just move it from `drafts/` into `posts/`. :)
