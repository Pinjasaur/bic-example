# My Draft Post

This is some draft post.

It won't be rendered under posts, but will exist under `/drafts` which is
disallowed from crawling in the [`/robots.txt`](../robots.txt).

It's a nice way to get feedback and iterate on a post. Once you're ready to
publish, just move it from `drafts/` into `posts/`. :)
