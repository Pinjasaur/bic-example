# Static Site Searching with Pagefind!
tags: announcement

Great news, I tried out integrating [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) on this
demo site and it works pretty slick. Needed to do a bit of config to correctly
set up dark mode UI and some overrides on some existing styling, but otherwise
it was pretty seamless.

It's configured to index pages and posts. Not drafts or other static content.

To try it, head over to the [Search page](/search).
